          <div class="panel-body">
            The most beneficial reason for preferring Additive Manufacturing over Conventional ones is its ability to produce complex geometry with precision in less time. In addition to that, Traditional Machining is subtractive in nature, which is removal of material, hence wastage. On the other hand, the name in itself holds the supremacy, where there is no wastage of materials, as the product is produced layer by layer.

        <div class="panel-collapse collapse" id="faq2">
          <div class="panel-body">Additive Manufacturing has its applications in more or less all the major industries, starting from Aerospace, Architecture, Automobile, Electronics, Defence, Mold making to Medical Industry. Every Industry is eventually absorbing the different techniques of Additive Manufacturing gradually for optimizing the product development cycle, hence reducing the production time. This shows the potential of Additive Manufacturing holds for us in the future.

            Yes, these are proven processes, and are being applied by different sectors for various purposes, according to the requirements. Medical Sector specifically has its own unique advantage, where imaging and modelling (Reverse Engineering) are done followed by manufacturing or rather 3d Printing of the part, which is then replaced for proper functioning. The time is not far away when, organs transplantation would not be complicated enough, owing to the opportunities 3D printing holds for us.

            Additive Manufacturing has been around in the market since late 1980s, but it started gaining its impact from last 5-7 years. The technology is capable enough to produce polymers, metals, ceramics of intricate shapes with fine detailing. The technology is still developing, unleashing the prospects of further developments of producing complex materials.

            The usual process of developing any product starts from designing of a CAD model followed by its manufacturing. Whereas Reverse Engineering is just the opposite, where the procedure starts with a tangible product and ends with digitization of the product along with the specifications (geometric 3D model, after polygonisation, meshing and hence the CAD model) from point cloud, which are collected by different 3D scanners. Reverse Engineering is specifically useful in case of lack of documentation, no manufacturing or replication of an existing product.

            Reverse Engineering can be used for systematic evaluation of a product, which has been functioning for a certain time period by comparing it with a freshly manufactured version of the same product. It is helpful in the recovery of any damaged or broken part, thereby improving the quality and efficiency of the component.
